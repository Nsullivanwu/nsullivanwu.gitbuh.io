```{r}
coffeedata <- tidytuesdayR:: tt_load('2020-07-07')
coffee_ratings <- coffeedata$coffee_ratings
```

The data is provided by James LeDoux and comes from Coffee Quality Database (link: <https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database>). The original data is on LeDoux's Github and was re-posted to Kaggle.com (link: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volpatto/coffee-quality-database-from-cqi>).

```{r}
library(dplyr)
coffee_ratings |>
  select(total_cup_points, country_of_origin) |>
  group_by(country_of_origin)

coffee_ratings
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(coffee_ratings, aes(x = reorder(country_of_origin, total_cup_points), y = total_cup_points, fill = country_of_origin)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    coord_flip() + 
    labs(title = "Amount of cup points by country of origin", 
         x = "country of origin", 
         y = "total cup points") + 
    theme_minimal() + 
    theme(legend.position = "name")
```

Using Facet Wrapping, I will create a faceted graph to show histograms of total cup points for coffee ratings broken down by each country of origin.

```{r}
coffee_ratings <- coffee_ratings |>
  filter(!is.na(country_of_origin))

ggplot(coffee_ratings, aes(x = total_cup_points)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ country_of_origin) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Total Cup Points by Country of Origin",
    x = "Total Cup Points",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```
